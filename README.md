# Realtime Facemask Detection System Using OpenCV & TensorFlow
#### "Real-time Face Mask Detection" is a Deep Learning and Computer Vision project. This project detects human face masks using Python machine learning modules such as OpenCV and TensorFlow. This system is built as a custom deep learning model to detect whether or not a person is wearing a face mask. It will work on both still images and multiple real-time live video footages.
## Framework/Library Used
* *OpenCV*
* *Caffe-based Face Detector*
* *Keras*
* *TensorFlow*
* *MobileNetV2*
## Dataset
#### The dataset we used consists of 1951 face images collected from Flickr with and without masks. The dataset is created by *Cabani*, *Hammoudi*, *Benhabiles* and * *Melkemi* for their [MaskedFace-Net (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08016)

# Realtime Facemask Detection System Using OpenCV & TensorFlow
### "Real-time Face Mask Detection" is a Deep Learning and Computer Vision project. This project detects human face masks using Python machine learning modules such as OpenCV and TensorFlow. This system is built as a custom deep learning model to detect whether or not a person is wearing a face mask. It will work on both still images and multiple real-time live video footages.
